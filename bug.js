In React Native, when working with FlatList, using the `keyExtractor` prop incorrectly can lead to unexpected behavior such as incorrect rendering or performance issues.  A common mistake is to use the index as the key, which can cause problems when items are added, removed, or reordered.  The `keyExtractor` should provide a unique identifier for each item in the list, such as a database ID or UUID.
